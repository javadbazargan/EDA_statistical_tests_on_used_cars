- In the beginning, it was tried to comprehend numerical and categorical columns of data with plots .
- After that some Nan values in 3 non-numerical features were substituted with KNN method.
- Dataframe has obviously many outliers in numerical columns ,so for avoiding wrong conclusion in following statistical tests , in every statistical assessment , noise datas were removed .
- Correlation measures leads to so amazing conclusions which emerged the relationship between many staffs like price and horse power in used-cars market which have been clarified with heatmaps.
